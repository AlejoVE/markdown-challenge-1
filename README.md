#### A funny story <br>
Once upon a time when I was coming home I noticed a strange bird in the middle of the road (this story takes place in our wonderful city of Liège). He was visibly injured as he was not able to fly; a few cars swerved to avoid it. Frightened, it hid under a car that was parked along the street. Being the animal enthousiast that I am I recognized it was a sparrowhawk and since it is a protected species I decided to rescue it. As I was crawling on all four on the sidewalk trying to lure out the bird from its hiding spot I heard a loud voice "Lady what are you doing ?". It was a 10 years old who was visibly inquisitive about what I was doing. I explained to him that I was trying to rescue the injured bird. Then he said "Cool ! I'm with my friends from soccer, we're waiting for the bus. Can we help ?". And there I was, crawling on the sidewalk with a junior soccer team... The bird crossed the road and went in a playground under construction. The soccer team helped me climbing over the fence and I finally cornered the sparrowhawk. I threw my scarf on him and captured it, thanked the soccer team who was really in awe before the bird then I phoned my friend who works at a birds of prey's sanctuary. I entrusted her the bird and she confirmed it had a fractured wing. Sadly the poor thing didn't make it.
##### TL;DR :
Captured a bird of prey in the middle of a city with a junior soccer team to save him; it died.
